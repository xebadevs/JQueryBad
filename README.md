## Is JQuery still alive?

I understand that a part of the web developer work consist in upgrade the code. An even today, when the frameworks have been covered what JQuery does, their presence in websites is actually hugh, massive.

By the end of 2021, according to several researchs, is the **third most used JS library**, after **React** and **Angular JS**. So, as we can see, it's not that easy to dismiss it. *Ergo*, it seems convenient to know about its use and implementations.


## Inspiration

I want to include in this case a contact form, because their importance about client interaction, validations and for being such a common and useful section. And use **JQuery** to do that.

But, then, a form contact for who? And this amazing serie comes to my mind. From them, it was just connecting the dots, and have some fun during the process. You can see that in the way the contents are presented.

*Mission: to know about Heisenberg and her brand, products, privacity* (for the kind of products, of course) *and to contact her through a web form.*


## Quick Walkthrough

I search for the color palette to start with the design, wich I did again in Figma.

Then, some possible background images, till I found the aproppiate one. The same with the background on the different sections. Also a blue tone that match with the images in *Products*.

I edited a fragment of the chapter 19 of Season 2 for *About us* section video, showing the elaboration of the product.
