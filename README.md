# About JQueryBad ⚗


## Is JQuery still alive?

I understand that a part of the web developer work consist in upgrade the code. An even today, when the frameworks have been covered what JQuery does, their presence in websites is actually hugh, massive.

By the end of 2021, according to several researchs, is the **third most used JS library**, after **React** and **Angular JS**.

So, as we can see, it's not that easy to dismiss it. *Ergo*, it seems convenient to know about its use and implementations.

<br>



## Inspiration

I want to include in this case a contact form, because their importance about client interaction, validations and for being such a common and useful section. And use **JQuery** to do that.

But, then, a form contact for who? And this amazing serie comes to my mind: **Breaking Bad**. From then, it was just connecting the dots, and have some fun during the process. You can see that in the way the contents are presented.

*Mission: to know about Heisenberg and her brand, products, privacity* (for the kind of products, of course) *and to contact him through a web form.*

## Quick Walkthrough

I search for the color palette to start with the design, wich I did again in Figma.

Then, some possible background images, till I found the aproppiate ones. Also a blue tone that match with the images in *Products*.

I edited a fragment of the chapter 19 of Season 2 for *About us* section video, showing the elaboration of the product, including the main theme from the TV show.

It was also a good idea to include some common pattern for the different sections, for which I chose the sexagons.

In the landscape viewports, at the end, appears Heisenberg again, closing the circle of the design.

## Technical Comments

The extensive use of `media queries` is due to their practice itself: sometimes quick solutions are required and it seemed like a good opportunity to put them into practice, before applying the most current responsive methods.

You may have a problem related to the `Scroll` if you use `Mozilla Firefox` (at least in the current versions at the time of making the project).
