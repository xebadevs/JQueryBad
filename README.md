## Is JQuery still alive?

I understand that a part of the web developer work consist in upgrade the code. An even today, when the frameworks have been covered what JQuery does, their presence in websites is actually hugh, massive.

By the end of 2021, according to several researchs, is the **third most used JS library**, after *React* and *Angular JS*. So, as we can see, it's not that easy to dismiss it. *Ergo*, it seems convenient to know about its use and implementations.

## Inspiration

I want to include in this case a contact form, because their importance about client interaction, validations (at least in the front-end in the current project) and for being such a common and useful section. And use JQuery to that.

But, then, a form contact for who? And this amazing serie comes to my mind. From them, it was just connecting the dots.

Mission: to know about Heisenberg and her brand, products, privacity (for the kind of products, of course) and to contact her through a web form.

## Features

- JQuery
- CSS compilation with Less
